## Data analysis on children’s screen time patterns.
# 📊 Children's Screen Time Dashboard

This project explores real-world trends in children's screen time using a dataset that breaks down 
**educational** **recreational** screen timefor children aged **5 to 15 years**.
The data is categorized by **age**, **gender**, and **day type** (Weekday vs. Weekend), and provides insights into 
screen habits across demographics.

The dataset reflects realistic behavior patterns, such as:
- Increasing screen time with age
- Recreational use dominating total screen time
- Higher usage on weekends than weekdays

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- PivotTables & PivotCharts  
- Slicers for interactivity  
- Conditional formatting for emphasis  
- Basic statistical functions (average)

## 📌 Key Questions Explored
- How does screen time vary with age?
- What is the average recreational vs. educational screen time?
- How do weekends differ from weekdays in screen habits?
- Are there gender-based variations in screen time?

## 💡 Dashboard Preview

Just from the look of this dashboard we note that the average screen time increases the older the children get.
We also see that the male child has the highest overall screen time.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Teenagers (13–15) spend approximately twice as much screen time as 5-year-olds, suggesting greater freedom or
- less structure/supervised time periods among the teenage groups.
- Recreational time accounts for nearly 75% of total screen time.
- Weekend screen time is 20–30% higher than weekday screen time.
- **Gender-based variations**:
  - Male children tend to spend more time on **recreational** screen activities.

## Recommendation
Actively engage high educational screen time among children across all demographics so as to encourage balanced screen time.
